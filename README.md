# Spotify-Playlist-Generator

Developed a Spotify playlist generator using Python and the Spotify API. Utilized web scraping techniques to gather song data from the Billboard Top 100 based on a specific date input by the user. Songs are automatically to a designated playlist on the userâ€™s Spotify account using OAuth 2.0.
